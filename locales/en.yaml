  📚 *Welcome to your DankY assistant for Anki!*

  If you're a language learner and you use Anki every day, 
  you probably know how tedious it is to create flashcards manually. 
  Collecting *definitions*, *examples*, *IPA*, *translations*, *synonyms*, and *antonyms* over and over can get boring fast.

  🤖 *What is DankY?*
  DankY is *an automated Telegram bot that generates flashcards for you using open-source dictionaries.* 
  Currently it supports English vocabulary, with more languages like German coming soon!

  ✨ *Features*

  🗂️ Includes up to 15 definition–example pairs, plus IPA, translations, synonyms, and antonyms

  ⚙️ *How to use DankY?*
  1. Make sure Anki is running with AnkiConnect enabled
  2. Send me a word in English (German support coming soon!)
  3. Wait a few seconds ⏳
  4. Receive confirmation when the flashcard is added

  🧠 *Goal*
