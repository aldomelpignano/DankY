## Fixed Issues (Resolved in Recent Updates)
# These issues have been addressed but are kept for reference:

1. ✅ **No message when deck not selected**
   - Status: FIXED
   - Description: Previously, when sending a word without a deck selected, no error message was shown.
   - Solution: Added proper error handling that displays a localized message when no deck is selected.

2. ✅ **Delayed processing message**
   - Status: FIXED
   - Description: The "Processing..." message appeared with a delay, making the bot feel unresponsive.
   - Solution: Processing message now appears immediately and updates in real-time with success/error messages.

## Current Known Issues

1. **Duplicate detection across all decks**
   - Status: OPEN
   - Severity: Medium
   - Description: The bot checks for duplicate words across all decks in Anki, not just the selected deck. 
     If a word exists in any deck, it will be rejected even if it doesn't exist in the currently selected deck.
   - Impact: Users cannot add the same word to different decks.
   - Workaround: Use different deck names or manually add words to different decks via Anki.
   - Expected behavior: Duplicate check should only consider the currently selected deck.
